NOTE = Basic version of Ranked Ant Colony Optimization incorporating an additional hyperparameter to set the quantity of pheromone left by an ant on the city-to-city edge after it visits the city. This allows additional control over exploration and exploitation + as determined experimentally, increasing likelihood of obtaining optimal/close to optimal solutions. This implementation also incorporates basic 2-opt local search techniques to refine discovered tours and allows convergence in less iterations. This iteration's result was achieved using the following hyperparameters { "ANT_COUNT": 10, "ITERATIONS_COUNT": 125, "ALPHA": 3, "BETA": 1, "RHO": 0.2, "W": 6, "Q": 10, "TWO_OPT_PERIOD": 1 }
