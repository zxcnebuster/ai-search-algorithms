NOTE = Basic version of Ranked Ant Colony Optimization incorporating an additional hyperparameter to set the quantity of pheromone left by an ant on the city-to-city edge after it visits the city. This allows additional control over exploration and exploitation + as determined experimentally, increasing likelihood of obtaining optimal/close to optimal solutions. This implementation also incorporates basic 2-opt local search techniques to refine discovered tours and allows convergence in less iterations
